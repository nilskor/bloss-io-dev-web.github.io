        <h2 class="h2">In Plain English</h2>

        <p>
            There are no deliberate mechanisms (by Nilskör) built into the following products that collect any personal 
            information whatsoever:
            <ul class="liDash">
                <li class="skiptranslate">'bloss' Operating System (bloss)(bloss OS)</li>
            </ul>
            Similarly, we have zero interest in collecting data. Our passion lies in writing software. If you choose to 
            correspond with us regarding products or services, and you share some personal information, then we are obliged 
            to keep that confidential. Similarly, there is no code in our web site that stores cookies. Our web site does 
            use localStorage and sessionStorage for the proper functioning of our Single Page Application framework.
        </p>
        <p>
            The following is more legally correct, but does not differ from the above plain english definition just stated.
        </p>

        <h2 class="h2">Privacy Policy</h2>

        </p>

        <h2 class="h2">Security of Personal Information</h2>

        <p>
            Your Personal Information is stored in a manner that reasonably protects it from misuse and loss and from

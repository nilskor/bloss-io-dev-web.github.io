            Nilskör is a young, dynamic company born in Australia.
            <div class="paraSpace_10">&nbsp;</div>
            
            Its vision for the future is simple - make tech easier to use.
            <div class="paraSpace_10">&nbsp;</div>
            
            We are a people first company, and that's the whole point. We want people to be out enjoying their lives, 
            doing what they love the best. The moment that technology gets in the way, or takes hours to sort out the 
            ridiculously easy things, we're on the wrong path.
            <div class="paraSpace_10">&nbsp;</div>
            
            The first steps to realising our vision are:
            <ol>
                <li>an operating system as the platform to deliver our services and products</li>
                <li>documentation, specifically, clear and easy to understand documentation</li>
            </ol>
            <div class="paraSpace_10">&nbsp;</div>

            The operating system is named&nbsp;<span class="skiptranslate bold">bloss</span>&nbsp;, and it is a 
            Linux<sup class="codeGrey">1</sup> 
            based product. And that's all we're going to say. There's no need for infinite discussion about which flavour 
            of OS is better or worse than another. All we want recognised is that Linux has a place on the desktop as well 
            as Windows<sup class="codeGrey">2</sup> and macOS<sup class="codeGrey">3</sup>, and that it can be a 
            beautiful experience. Hence, beautiful Linux operating system 
            becomes&nbsp;<span class="skiptranslate bold">b.l.OS</span>&nbsp;or 
            simply&nbsp;<span class="skiptranslate">bloss</span>!
            
            <div class="paraSpace_10">&nbsp;</div>

            Additionally, we are keen to provide&nbsp;<span class="skiptranslate bold">bloss</span>&nbsp;already 
            pre-installed on tablets, laptops and PCs, as well as provide support services for customer installations.
            <div class="paraSpace_10">&nbsp;</div>

            The future roadmap includes AI, and we're excited about our internal models and what they might be capable 
            of in the near future.

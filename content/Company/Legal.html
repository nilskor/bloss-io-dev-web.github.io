            <li>The Kö-Bogen II building in Düsseldorf, Germany. Photo Copyright: HGEsch Photography (our Index page).<br>
                <i class="codeGrey"> 
                Designed by Ingenhoven Architects, Düsseldorf, Germany. 8 kilometres of hornbeam hedges, over 30,000 
                plants – Europe’s largest green facade is complete. The facade is an essential element of the Kö-Bogen 
                II commercial and office building by Ingenhoven Architects. The ensemble marks the conclusion of an 
                extensive urban renewal project in the heart of Düsseldorf. It also represents a paradigm shift: from an 
                urban perspective, it signals a departure from the automotive era and a turn towards people-oriented 
                planning. The ecological benefit of the hornbeam hedges is equivalent to that of approximately 80 fully 
                grown deciduous trees. This integration of nature into architecture offers a contemporary urban response 
                to climate change.

                15. Disclaimer of Warranty.<br>
                THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE 
                STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY

                If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal 
                effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates 
                an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption 
                of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.

                        If you are creating complex user interfaces, it is recommended to 
                        describe the structure of your window using the XML description format, 
                        instead of assembling it manually in code. 
                        <a data-id='page237'>GtkBuilder</a> 
                        has this XML description format, and you can also use a visual UI editor that will 
                        generate the XML for you (eg. <a class="external" target="_blank" href="https://glade.gnome.org/">Glade</a>).

            <h2>Index</h2>
            
            <h3><a id='bkmkGtkBuilder' data-id='page237'>GtkBuilder</a></h3>
            
            <div>
                A GtkBuilder object is an auxiliary object that reads textual descriptions 
                of a user interface and instantiates the described objects.
                <div class="paraSpace_10">&nbsp;</div>

                GtkBuilder parses textual descriptions of user interfaces which are 
                specified in an XML format which can be roughly described by the 
                <a data-id="page388">RELAX NG schema</a>. 
                These XML descriptions are referred to as “GtkBuilder UI 
                definitions” or just “UI definitions”. Do not confuse GtkBuilder UI 
                Definitions with GtkUIManager UI Definitions, which are more limited 
                in scope. It is common to use .ui as the filename extension for files 
                containing GtkBuilder UI definitions.
            </div>
            
            <h3><a id='bkmkGtkBuildable' data-id='page238'>GtkBuildable</a></h3>
            
            <div>
                GtkBuildable allows objects to extend and customize their deserialization 
                from GtkBuilder UI descriptions. The interface includes methods for setting 
                names and properties of objects, parsing custom tags and constructing child 
                objects.
                <div class="paraSpace_10">&nbsp;</div>

                The GtkBuildable interface is implemented by all widgets and many of the 
                non-widget objects that are provided by GTK. The main user of this interface 
                is GtkBuilder. There should be very little need for applications to call any 
                of these functions directly. An object only needs to implement this interface 
                if it needs to extend the GtkBuilder format or run any extra routines at 
                deserialization time.

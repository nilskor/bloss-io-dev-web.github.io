              This chapter describes in detail how GTK+ handles input. If you are interested in what 
              happens to translate a key press or mouse motion of the users into a change of a GTK+ widget, 
              you should read this chapter. This knowledge will also be useful if you decide to implement 
              your own widgets.

              The most basic input devices that every computer user has interacted with are keyboards and 
              mice; beyond these, GTK+ supports touchpads, touchscreens and more exotic input devices such 
              as graphics tablets. Inside GTK+, every such input device is represented by a 
              <a href="/content/GDK4/API_Reference/GdkDevice.html#GdkDevice"><span class="type">GdkDevice</span></a> 
              object.<br>
              <br>
              To simplify dealing with the variability between these input devices, GTK+ has a concept of 
              master and slave devices. The concrete physical devices that have many different characteristics 
              (mice may have 2 or 3 or 8 buttons, keyboards have different layouts and may or may not have 
              a separate number block, etc) are represented as slave devices. Each slave device is 
              associated with a virtual master device. Master devices always come in pointer/keyboard pairs 
              - you can think of such a pair as a 'seat'.<br>
              <br>
              GTK+ widgets generally deal with the master devices, and thus can be used with any pointing 
              device or keyboard.<br>
              <br>
              When a user interacts with an input device (e.g. moves a mouse or presses a key on the keyboard), 
              GTK+ receives events from the windowing system. These are typically directed at a specific 
              window - for pointer events, the window under the pointer (grabs complicate this), for keyboard 
              events, the window with the keyboard focus.<br>
              <br>
              GDK translates these raw windowing system events into <a href="/content/GDK4/API_Reference/Events.html#GdkEvent"><span class="type">GdkEvents</span></a>. 
              Typical input events are:
          
      </div>
      <div>
          
              <ul>
                <li>GdkEventButton</li>
                <li>GdkEventMotion</li>
                <li>GdkEventCrossing</li>
                <li>GdkEventKey</li>
                <li>GdkEventFocus</li>
                <li>GdkEventtouch</li>
              </ul> 
          
      </div>
      <div>
          
              Additionally, GDK/GTK synthesizes other signals to let know whether grabs (system-wide or 
              in-app) are taking input away:
          
      </div>
      <div>
          
              <ul>
                <li><a href="/content/GDK3/API_Reference/Event_Structures.html#GdkEventGrabBroken">GdkEventGrabBroken</a></li>
                <li><a href="/content/GTK3/Widgets Objects/Abstract_Base/GtkWidget.html#GtkWidget_grab_notify"><span class="type">“grab-notify”</span></a></li>
              </ul> 
          
      </div>
      <div>
          
              When GTK+ is initialized, it sets up an event handler function with <a href="/content/GDK3/API_Reference/Events.html#gdk_event_handler_set"><code class="function">gdk_event_handler_set()</code></a>, 
              which receives all of these input events (as well as others, for instance window management 
              related events).

      <div>
          
              For widgets which have a <a href="/content/GDK3/API_Reference/Windows.html#GdkWindow"><span class="type">GdkWindow</span></a> 
              set, events are received from the windowing system and passed to <a href="/content/GTK3/GTK_Core_References/Main_loop.html#gtk_main_do_event"><code class="function">gtk_main_do_event()</code></a>. 
              See its documentation for details of what it does: compression of enter/leave events, 
              identification of the widget receiving the event, pushing the event onto a stack for <a href="/content/GTK3/GTK_Core_References/Main_loop.html#gtk_get_current_event"><code class="function">gtk_get_current_event()</code></a>, 
              and propagating the event to the widget.<br>
              <br>
              When a GDK backend produces an input event, it is tied to a <span class="type">GdkDevice</span> 
              and a <span class="type">GdkWindow</span>, which in turn represents a windowing system surface 
              in the backend. If a widget has grabbed the current input device, or all input devices, the 
              event is propagated to that <a href="/content/GTK3/Widgets Objects/Abstract_Base/GtkWidget.html"><span class="type">GtkWidget</span></a>. 
              Otherwise, it is propagated to the the <span class="type">GtkWidget</span> which calls <a href="/content/GTK3/Widgets Objects/Abstract_Base/GtkWidget.html#gtk_widget_register_window"><code class="function">gtk_widget_register_window()</code></a> 
              on the <span class="type">GdkWindow</span> receiving the event.<br>
              <br>
              Grabs are implemented for each input device, and globally. A grab for a specific input device 
              (<a href="/content/GTK3/GTK_Core_References/Main_loop.html#gtk_device_grab_add"><code class="function">gtk_device_grab_add()</code></a>), 
              is sent events in preference to a global grab (<a href="/content/GTK3/GTK_Core_References/Main_loop.html#gtk_grab_add"><code class="function">gtk_grab_add()</code></a>). 
              Input grabs only have effect within the <a href="/content/GTK3/Widgets Objects/Windows/GtkWindowGroup.html"><span class="type">GtkWindowGroup</span></a> 
              containing the <span class="type">GtkWidget</span> which registered the event’s <span class="type">GdkWindow</span>. 
              If this <span class="type">GtkWidget</span> is a child of the grab widget, the event is 
              propagated to the child — this is the basis for propagating events within modal dialogs.<br>
              <br>
              An event is propagated to a widget using <a href="/content/GTK3/GTK_Core_References/Main_loop.html#gtk_propagate_event"><code class="function">gtk_propagate_event()</code></a>. 
              Propagation differs between event types: key events (<a href="/content/GDK4/API_Reference/Events.html#GDK_KEY_PRESS"><code class="literal">GDK_KEY_PRESS</code></a>, 
              <a href="/content/GDK4/API_Reference/Events.html#GDK_KEY_RELEASE"><code class="literal">GDK_KEY_RELEASE</code></a>) 
              are delivered to the top-level <a href="/content/GTK3/Widgets Objects/Windows/GtkWindow.html"><span class="type">GtkWindow</span></a>; 
              other events are propagated down and up the widget hierarchy in three phases (see 
              <a href="/content/GTK3/Widgets Objects/Gestures_handling/GtkEventController.html#GtkPropagationPhase"><span class="type">GtkPropagationPhase</span></a>).<br>
              <br>
              For key events, the top-level window’s default <span class="type">“key-press-event”</span> 
              and <span class="type">“key-release-event”</span> signal handlers handle mnemonics and 
              accelerators first. Other key presses are then passed to <a href="/content/GTK3/Widgets Objects/Windows/GtkWindow.html#gtk_window_propagate_key_event"><code class="function">gtk_window_propagate_key_event()</code></a> 
              which propagates the event upwards from the window’s current focus widget (<a href="/content/GTK3/Widgets Objects/Windows/GtkWindow.html#gtk_window_get_focus"><code class="function">gtk_window_get_focus()</code></a>) 
              to the top-level.<br>
              <br>
              For other events, in the first phase (the “capture” phase) the event is delivered to each 
              widget from the top-most (for example, the top-level <span class="type">GtkWindow</span> or 
              grab widget) down to the target <span class="type">GtkWidget</span>. <a href="#Event_controllers_and_gestures">Gestures</a> 
              that are attached with <a href="/content/GTK3/Widgets Objects/Gestures_handling/GtkEventController.html#GTK_PHASE_CAPTURE"><code class="literal">GTK_PHASE_CAPTURE</code></a> 
              get a chance to react to the event.<br>
              <br>
              After the “capture” phase, the widget that was intended to be the destination of the event 
              will run gestures attached to it with <a href="/content/GTK3/Widgets Objects/Gestures_handling/GtkEventController.html#GTK_PHASE_TARGET"><code class="literal">GTK_PHASE_TARGET</code></a>. 
              This is known as the “target” phase, and only happens on that widget.<br>
              <br>
              Next, the <a href="/content/GTK3/Widgets Objects/Abstract_Base/GtkWidget.html#GtkWidget_event"><span class="type">“event”</span></a> 
              signal is emitted, then the appropriate signal for the event in question, for example <a href="/content/GTK3/Widgets Objects/Abstract_Base/GtkWidget.html#GtkWidget_motion_notify_event"><span class="type">“motion-notify-event”</span></a>. 
              Handling these signals was the primary way to handle input in GTK+ widgets before gestures 
              were introduced. If the widget is realized, the <a href="/content/GTK3/Widgets Objects/Abstract_Base/GtkWidget.html#GtkWidget_event_after"><span class="type">“event-after”</span></a> 
              signal is emitted. The signals are emitted from the target widget up to the top-level, as 
              part of the “bubble” phase.<br>
              <br>
              The default handlers for the event signals send the event to gestures that are attached with 
              <a href="/content/GTK3/Widgets Objects/Gestures_handling/GtkEventController.html#GTK_PHASE_BUBBLE"><code class="literal">GTK_PHASE_BUBBLE</code></a>. 
              Therefore, gestures in the “bubble” phase are only used if the widget does not have its own 
              event handlers, or takes care to chain up to the default <span class="type">GtkWidget</span> 
              handlers.<br>
              <br>
              Events are not delivered to a widget which is insensitive or unmapped.<br>
              <br>
              Any time during the propagation phase, a widget may indicate that a received event was 
              consumed and propagation should therefore be stopped. In traditional event handlers, this is 
              hinted by returning <a href="/content/GDK4/API_Reference/Events.html#GDK_EVENT_STOP"><code class="literal">GDK_EVENT_STOP</code></a>. 
              If gestures are used, this may happen when the widget tells the gesture to claim the event 
              touch sequence (or the pointer events) for its own. See the "gesture states" section below 
              to know more of the latter.

      <div>
          
              Each widget instance has a basic event mask and another per input device, which determine 
              the types of input event it receives. Each event mask set on a widget is added to the 
              corresponding (basic or per-device) event mask for the widget’s <span class="type">GdkWindow</span>, 
              and all child <span class="type">GdkWindows</span>.<br>
              <br>
              If a widget is windowless (<a href="/content/GTK3/Widgets Objects/Abstract_Base/GtkWidget.html#gtk_widget_get_has_window"><code class="function">gtk_widget_get_has_window()</code></a> 
              returns <code class="literal">FALSE</code>) and an application wants to receive custom events 
              on it, it must be placed inside a <a href="/content/GTK3/Widgets Objects/Miscellaneous/GtkEventBox.html"><span class="type">GtkEventBox</span></a> 
              to receive the events, and an appropriate event mask must be set on the box. When implementing 
              a widget, use a <code class="literal">GDK_INPUT_ONLY</code> <span class="type">GdkWindow</span> 
              to receive the events instead.<br>
              <br>
              Filtering events against event masks happens inside <span class="type">GdkWindow</span>, 
              which exposes event masks to the windowing system to reduce the number of events GDK 
              receives from it. On receiving an event, it is filtered against the <span class="type">GdkWindow</span>’s 
              mask for the input device, if set. Otherwise, it is filtered against the <span class="type">GdkWindow</span>’s 
              basic event mask.<br>
              <br>
              This means that widgets must add to the event mask for each event type they expect to 
              receive, using <a href="/content/GTK3/Widgets Objects/Abstract_Base/GtkWidget.html#gtk_widget_set_events"><code class="function">gtk_widget_set_events()</code></a> 
              or <a href="/content/GTK3/Widgets Objects/Abstract_Base/GtkWidget.html#gtk_widget_add_events"><code class="function">gtk_widget_add_events()</code></a> 
              to preserve the existing mask. Widgets which are aware of floating devices should use <a href="/content/GTK3/Widgets Objects/Abstract_Base/GtkWidget.html#gtk_widget_set_device_events"><code class="function">gtk_widget_set_device_events()</code></a> 
              or <a href="/content/GTK3/Widgets Objects/Abstract_Base/GtkWidget.html#gtk_widget_add_device_events"><code class="function">gtk_widget_add_device_events()</code></a>, 
              and must explicitly enable the device using <a href="/content/GTK3/Widgets Objects/Abstract_Base/GtkWidget.html#gtk_widget_set_device_enabled"><code class="function">gtk_widget_set_device_enabled()</code></a>. 
              See the <span class="type">GdkDeviceManager</span> documentation for more information.<br>
              <br>
              All standard widgets set the event mask for all events they expect to receive, and it is not 
              necessary to modify this. Masks should be set when implementing a new widget.

      <div>
          
              Touch events are emitted as events of type <a href="/content/GDK4/API_Reference/Events.html#GDK_TOUCH_BEGIN"><code class="literal">GDK_TOUCH_BEGIN</code></a>, 
              <a href="/content/GDK4/API_Reference/Events.html#GDK_TOUCH_UPDATE"><code class="literal">GDK_TOUCH_UPDATE</code></a>

              those events contain an “event sequence” that univocally identifies the physical touch until 
              it is lifted from the device.<br>
              <br>
              On some windowing platforms, multitouch devices perform pointer emulation, this works by 
              granting a “pointer emulating” hint to one of the currently interacting touch sequences, 
              which will be reported on every <span class="type">GdkEventTouch</span> event from that 
              sequence. By default, if a widget didn't request touch events by setting <a href="/content/GDK4/API_Reference/Events.html#GDK_TOUCH_MASK"><code class="literal">GDK_TOUCH_MASK</code></a> 
              on its event mask and didn't override <a href="/content/GTK3/Widgets Objects/Abstract_Base/GtkWidget.html#GtkWidget_touch_event"><span class="type">“touch-event”</span></a>, 
              GTK+ will transform these “pointer emulating” events into semantically similar <span class="type">GdkEventButton</span> 
              and <span class="type">GdkEventMotion</span> events. Depending on <a href="/content/GDK4/API_Reference/Events.html#GDK_TOUCH_MASK"><code class="literal">GDK_TOUCH_MASK</code></a> 
              being in the event mask or not, non-pointer-emulating sequences could still trigger gestures 
              or just get filtered out, regardless of the widget not handling those directly.<br>
              <br>
              If the widget sets <code class="literal">GDK_TOUCH_MASK</code> on its event mask and doesn't 
              chain up on <span class="type">“touch-event”</span>, only touch events will be received, and 
              no pointer emulation will be performed.

              <span style= "font-size: 1.17em; font-weight: 700;">Grabs</span><br>
          
      </div>
      <div>
          
              Grabs are a method to claim all input events from a device, they happen either implicitly on 
              pointer and touch devices, or explicitly. Implicit grabs happen on user interaction, when a 
              <span class="type">GdkEventButtonPress</span> happens, all events from then on, until after 
              the corresponding <span class="type">GdkEventButtonRelease</span>, will be reported to the 
              widget that got the first event. Likewise, on touch events, every <a href="/content/GDK4/API_Reference/Events.html#GdkEventSequence"><span class="type">GdkEventSequence</span></a> 
              will deliver only events to the widget that received its <code class="literal">GDK_TOUCH_BEGIN</code> 
              event.<br>
              <br>
              Explicit grabs happen programatically (both activation and deactivation), and can be either 
              system-wide (GDK grabs) or application-wide (GTK grabs). On the windowing platforms that 
              support it, GDK grabs will prevent any interaction with any other application/window/widget 
              than the grabbing one, whereas GTK grabs will be effective only within the application 
              (across all its windows), still allowing for interaction with other applications.<br>
              <br>
              But one important aspect of grabs is that they may potentially happen at any point somewhere 
              else, even while the pointer/touch device is already grabbed. This makes it necessary for 
              widgets to handle the cancellation of any ongoing interaction. Depending on whether a GTK or 
              GDK grab is causing this, the widget will respectively receive a <span class="type">“grab-notify”</span> 
              signal, or a <span class="type">GdkEventGrabBroken</span> event.<br>
              <br>
              On gestures, these signals are handled automatically, causing the gesture to cancel all 
              tracked pointer/touch events, and signal the end of recognition.

              Event controllers are standalone objects that can perform specific actions upon received 
              <span class="type">GdkEvents</span>. These are tied to a <span class="type">GtkWidget</span>, 
              and can be told of the event propagation phase at which they will manage the events.<br>
              <br>
              Gestures are a set of specific controllers that are prepared to handle pointer and/or touch 
              events, each gestures implementation attempts to recognize specific actions out the received 
              events, notifying of the state/progress accordingly to let the widget react to those. On 
              multi-touch gestures, every interacting touch sequence will be tracked independently.<br>
              <br>
              Being gestures “simple” units, it is not uncommon to tie several together to perform higher 
              level actions, grouped gestures handle the same event sequences simultaneously, and those 
              sequences share a same state across all grouped gestures. Some examples of grouping may be:
          
      </div>
      <div>
          
              <ul>
                <li>A “drag” and a “swipe” gestures may want grouping. The former will report events as 
                    the dragging happens, the latter will tell the swipe X/Y velocities only after the gesture 
                    has finished.</li>
                <li>Grouping a “drag” gesture with a “pan” gesture will only effectively allow dragging in 
                    the panning orientation, as both gestures share state.</li>
                <li>If “press” and “long press” are wanted simultaneously, those would need grouping.</li>
              </ul> 
          
      </div>
 <hr class="para">
      <div>
          
              <span style= "font-size: 1.17em; font-weight: 700;">Gesture states</span><br>
          
      </div>
      <div>
          
              Gestures have a notion of “state” for each individual touch sequence. When events from a 
              touch sequence are first received, the touch sequence will have “none” state, this means the 
              touch sequence is being handled by the gesture to possibly trigger actions, but the event 
              propagation will not be stopped.<br>
              <br>
              When the gesture enters recognition, or at a later point in time, the widget may choose to 
              claim the touch sequences (individually or as a group), hence stopping event propagation 
              after the event is run through every gesture in that widget and propagation phase. Anytime 
              this happens, the touch sequences are cancelled downwards the propagation chain, to let these 
              know that no further events will be sent.<br>
              <br>
              Alternatively, or at a later point in time, the widget may choose to deny the touch sequences, 
              thus letting those go through again in event propagation. When this happens in the capture 
              phase, and if there are no other claiming gestures in the widget, a <code class="literal">GDK_TOUCH_BEGIN</code>/
              <a href="/content/GDK4/API_Reference/Events.html#GDK_BUTTON_PRESS"><code class="literal">GDK_BUTTON_PRESS</code></a> 
              event will be emulated and propagated downwards, in order to preserve consistency.<br>
              <br>
              Grouped gestures always share the same state for a given touch sequence, so setting the state 
              on one does transfer the state to the others. They also are mutually exclusive, within a 
              widget there may be only one gesture group claiming a given sequence. If another gesture 
              group claims later that same sequence, the first group will deny the sequence.

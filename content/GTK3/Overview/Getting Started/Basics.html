                    In a GTK application, the purpose of the <b>main</b> function is to create a <a data-id="page184">GtkApplication</a>
                     object and run it. In this example, a GtkApplication pointer named <b>app</b> is called and then initialized using 
                    [TODO-proper bookmark link]<b><a data-id="page184">gtk_application_new</a></b>.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    When creating a GtkApplication, you need to pick an application identifier (a name), and then input that to 
                    <b>gtk_application_new</b> as a parameter. For this example, <b>"org.gtk.example"</b> is used, but for choosing 
                    an identifier for your application, see 
                    <a class="external" target="_blank" href="https://wiki.gnome.org/HowDoI/ChooseApplicationID">this guide</a>. 
                    Lastly, <b><code class="function">gtk_application_new</code></b> takes a GApplicationFlags as input for your application 
                    (this is done if your application has any custom requirements that you may want to program in).<br>
                    <br>
                    Next, the 
                    <a class="external" target="_blank" href="https://developer.gnome.org/gio/stable/GApplication.html#GApplication-activate">activate signal</a> 
                    is connected to the <b>activate</b> function (located just above the <b>main</b> function). 
                    The <b>activate</b> signal will be sent when your application is launched from the <b>g_application_run</b> (on the 
                    line below). The <b>gtk_application_run</b> also takes as arguments the pointers to the command line arguments counter 
                    and string array; this allows GTK to parse specific command line arguments that control the behavior of GTK itself. 
                    The parsed arguments will be removed from the array, leaving the unrecognized ones for your application to parse (if
                    you so choose).<br>
                    <br>
                    Within <b>g_application_run</b>, the <b>activate</b> signal is sent and the program flow then proceeds into the 
                    <b>activate</b> function of the application. Inside the activate function we want to construct our GTK window, 
                    so that a window is shown when the application is launched. The call to [TODO-proper bookmark link] 
                    <a data-id="page182">gtk_application_window_new</a> will create a new <a data-id="page82">GtkWindow</a> and store 
                    it inside the <b>window</b> pointer. The window will have a frame, a title bar, and window controls depending 
                    on the platform (Operating System).<br>
                    <br>
                    A window title is set using [TODO-proper bookmark link]<a data-id="page82">gtk_window_set_title</a>. This function 
                    takes a GtkWindow* pointer and a string as input. As the 'window' pointer is a <a data-id="page92">GtkWidget</a> 
                    pointer, we need to cast it to GtkWindow*. But instead of casting 'window' via (GtkWindow*), 'window' can be cast 
                    using the macro function <b>GTK_WINDOW</b>. 
                    Macro function 'GTK_WINDOW' will check if the pointer is an instance of the GtkWindow class before casting, and emit 
                    a warning if the check fails. More information about this convention can be found [TODO]
                    <a class="external" target="_blank" href="https://developer.gnome.org/gobject/stable/gtype-conventions.html">here</a>.<br>
                    <br>
                    Finally the window size is set using <b>gtk_window_set_default_size</b> and the window is finally shown using 
                    [TODO-proper bookmark link]<a data-id="page92">gtk_widget_show_all</a>.<br>
                    <br>
                    When you exit the window, for example by clicking the X, the <b>g_application_run</b> in the main loop returns 
                    with a number which is saved inside an integer named "status". Afterwards, the <b>GtkApplication</b> object is 
                    freed from memory with <b>g_object_unref</b>. Finally, the status integer is returned and the application exits.<br>
                    <br>
                    While the program is running, GTK is constantly receiving events in the background. These are typically input 
                    events caused by the person interacting with your program, but also things like messages from the window manager, 
                    timers or other applications. GTK processes these and as a result, signals may be emitted into your widgets (into
                    your application). Connecting handlers for these signals is how you normally make your program do something in 
                    response to user input.<br>
                    <br>
                    The following example is slightly more complex, and tries to showcase some of the capabilities of GTK.<br>
                    <br>
                    In the long tradition of programming languages and libraries, it is called 
                    <b><span class="emphasis"><em>'Hello, World'</em></span></b>.<br>
                    <br>
                    <img src="/content/GTK3/Overview/Getting Started/hello-world.png"></img><br>
                    <br>
                
            </div>
            <div>
                
                    <span style= "font-size: 1.17em; font-weight: 700;">Example 1. Hello World in GTK</span><br>
                
            </div>
            <div>
                
                    Create a new file with the following content named example-1.c
                
            </div>
            <div class="code" style="white-space: pre;">
    #include &lt;gtk/gtk.h&gt;

    static void
    print_hello( GtkWidget *widget, gpointer data )
    {
        g_print( "Hello World\n" );
    }

    static void
    activate( GtkApplication *app, gpointer user_data )
    {
        GtkWidget *window;
        GtkWidget *button;
        GtkWidget *button_box;

        window = gtk_application_window_new( app );
        gtk_window_set_title( GTK_WINDOW( window ), "Window" );
        gtk_window_set_default_size( GTK_WINDOW( window ), 200, 200 );

        button_box = gtk_button_box_new( GTK_ORIENTATION_HORIZONTAL );
        gtk_container_add( GTK_CONTAINER( window ), button_box );

        button = gtk_button_new_with_label( "Hello World" );
        g_signal_connect( button, "clicked", G_CALLBACK( print_hello ), NULL );
        g_signal_connect_swapped( button, "clicked", G_CALLBACK( gtk_widget_destroy ), window );
        gtk_container_add( GTK_CONTAINER( button_box ), button );

        gtk_widget_show_all( window );
    }

    int
    main( int argc, char **argv )
    {
        GtkApplication *app;
        int status;

        app = gtk_application_new( "org.gtk.example", G_APPLICATION_FLAGS_NONE );
        g_signal_connect( app, "activate", G_CALLBACK( activate ), NULL );
        status = g_application_run( G_APPLICATION( app ), argc, argv );
        g_object_unref( app );

        return status;
    }
            </div> 

            <div>
                You can compile the program above with GCC using:
            </div>

            <div>
                <span class="code">gcc `pkg-config --cflags gtk+-3.0` -o example-1 example-1.c `pkg-config --libs gtk+-3.0`</span>
            </div>
            
            <div>
                
                    As seen above, example-1.c builds further upon example-0.c by adding a button to our window, with the 
                    label "Hello World". Two new GtkWidget pointers (variables) are declared to accomplish this, <b>'button'</b> and 
                    <b>'button_box'</b>. The 'button_box' variable is created to store a <a data-id="page142">GtkButtonBox</a>,
                    which is GTK's way of controlling the size and layout of buttons. The GtkButtonBox is created and assigned 
                    using [TODO]<a data-id="page142">gtk_button_box_new</a>, which takes a [TODO]<a data-id="page10">GtkOrientation</a> 
                    enum (enumeration) as a parameter. The buttons which this box will contain can either be stored horizontally or vertically, 
                    but this does not matter in this particular case, as we are dealing with only one button. After initializing 
                    button_box with horizontal orientation, the code adds the button_box widget to the window widget using 
                    [TODO]<a data-id="page94">gtk_container_add</a>.<br>
                    <br>
                    Next, the <b>button</b> variable is initialized in a similar manner. [TODO]<a data-id="page73">Gtk_button_new_with_label</a> 
                    is called which returns a <b>GtkButton</b> object to be stored inside the variable 'button'. Afterwards, 'button' 
                    is added to our <b>button_box</b>.<br>
                    <br>
                    Using <b>g_signal_connect</b>, the button is connected to a function in our app called <b>print_hello</b>, 
                    so that when the button is clicked, GTK will call this function. As the 'print_hello' function does not use any data 
                    as input, NULL is passed to it. 'print_hello' calls <b>g_print</b> with the string <i>"Hello World"</i>, 
                    which will print 'Hello World' in a terminal if the GTK application was started from there.<br>
                    <br>
                    After connecting <b>print_hello</b>, another signal is connected to the "clicked" state of the button using 
                    <b>g_signal_connect_swapped</b>. This functions is similar to a <b>g_signal_connect</b>, with the difference 
                    being in how the callback function is treated. <b>g_signal_connect_swapped</b> allows you to specify what the 
                    callback function should take as parameter, by letting you pass it as data. In this case, the function being 
                    'called back' is [TODO]<a data-id="page92">gtk_widget_destroy</a> and the 'window' pointer variable is passed 
                    to it. This has the effect that when the button is clicked, the whole GTK window is destroyed. In contrast, 
                    if a normal <b>g_signal_connect</b> were used to connect the "clicked" signal with <b>gtk_widget_destroy</b>, 
                    then the button itself would have been destroyed, not the window.<br>
                    <br>

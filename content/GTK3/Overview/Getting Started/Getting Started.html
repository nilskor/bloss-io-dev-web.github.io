                        GTK is a <a class="external" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Widget_toolkit">widget toolkit</a>. 
                        Each user interface created by GTK consists of widgets. 
                        This is implemented in C using GObject, an object-oriented framework for C.

                Widgets are organized in a hierachy. The window widget is the main container. The user interface 
                is then built by adding buttons, drop-down menus, input fields, and other widgets to the window. 
                If you are creating complex user interfaces it is recommended to use <a data-id='page237'>GtkBuilder</a> 
                and its GTK-specific markup description language, instead of assembling the user interface (UI) manually. 
                You can also use a visual user interface editor 
                (for example <a class="external" target="_blank" href="https://glade.gnome.org/" target="_blank">Glade</a>).<br>
                <br>
                GTK is event-driven. The toolkit listens for events such as clicks on a button, 
                and passes those events on to your application to handle.<br>

                This chapter contains some tutorial information to get you started with GTK programming. 
                It assumes that you have installed GTK, its dependencies, and a C compiler ready for use. 
                (If you need to build the GTK library itself first, then refer to the 
                <a data-id="page376">Compiling GTK Applications</a> section in this reference.

            To begin our introduction to GTK, we'll start with a simple signal-based Gtk application. 
                This program will create an empty 200 Ã— 200 pixel window.

      <div>
            When creating an application, you'll want to put more than one widget inside a window. 
                When you want to put more than one widget into a window, it becomes important to control 
                how each widget is positioned and sized. This is where packing comes in.

                When construcing a more complicated user interface, with dozens or hundreds of widgets, doing all 
                the setup work in C code is cumbersome, and making changes becomes more difficult and prone to errors.
                To assist with this, GTK supports the separation of user interface layout from your business logic, 
                by using UI descriptions in an XML format that can then be parsed by the GtkBuilder class.

                A typical application consists of numerous files. GTK includes application support that is built 
                on top of <b>GApplication</b>.<br><br>
                In this tutorial we'll build a simple application by starting from scratch, adding more and more pieces over time.

          <h3><a id='bkmkCustomDrawing' data-id='page351'>Custom Drawing</a></h3>
      </div>
      <div>
          Many widgets, like buttons, do all their drawing themselves. 
              You just tell them the label you want to see, and they figure out what font to use, 
              draw the button outline and focus rectangle, etc. 
              Sometimes, it is necessary to do some custom drawing. In that case, a 
              <a data-id="page194">GtkDrawingArea</a> 
              might be the right widget to use. 
              It offers a canvas on which you can draw by connecting to the [TODO-proper bookmark link] <a data-id="page92">draw</a> signal.

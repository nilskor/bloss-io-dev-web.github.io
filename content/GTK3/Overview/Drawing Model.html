              This chapter describes the GTK+ drawing model in detail.  If you are interested in the 
              procedure which GTK+ follows to draw its widgets and windows, you should read this chapter; 
              this will be useful to know if you decide to implement your own widgets. This chapter will 
              also clarify the reasons behind the ways certain things are done in GTK+; for example, why 
              you cannot change the background color of all widgets with the same method.

              Programs that run in a windowing system generally create rectangular regions in the screen 
              called <em class="firstterm">windows</em>. Traditional windowing systems do not 
              automatically save the graphical content of windows, and instead ask client programs to 
              repaint those windows whenever it is needed. For example, if a window that is stacked below 
              other windows gets raised to the top, then a client program has to repaint the area that was 
              previously obscured. When the windowing system asks a client program to redraw part of a 
              window, it sends an <em class="firstterm">exposure event</em> to the program for that window.<br>
              <br>
              Here, "windows" means "rectangular regions with automatic clipping", instead of "toplevel 
              application windows". Most windowing systems support nested windows, where the contents of 
              child windows get clipped by the boundaries of their parents. Although GTK+ and GDK in 
              particular may run on a windowing system with no such notion of nested windows, GDK presents 
              the illusion of being under such a system. A toplevel window may contain many subwindows and 
              sub-subwindows, for example, one for the menu bar, one for the document area, one for each 
              scrollbar, and one for the status bar.  In addition, controls that receive user input, such 
              as clickable buttons, are likely to have their own subwindows as well.<br>
              <br>
              In practice, most windows in modern GTK+ application are client-side constructs. Only a few 
              windows (in particular toplevel windows) are <span class="emphasis"><em>native</em></span>, 
              which means that they represent a window from the underlying windowing system on which GTK+ 
              is running. For example, on X11 it corresponds to a <span class="type">Window</span>; on 
              Win32, it corresponds to a <span class="type">HANDLE</span>.<br>
              <br>
              Generally, the drawing cycle begins when GTK+ receives an exposure event from the underlying 
              windowing system:  if the user drags a window over another one, the windowing system will 
              tell the underlying window that it needs to repaint itself. The drawing cycle can also be 
              initiated when a widget itself decides that it needs to update its display. For example, 
              when the user types a character in a <a class="two" href="/content/GTK3/Widgets Objects/Numeric_Text_Entry/GtkEntry.html"><code class="classname">GtkEntry</code></a> 
              widget, the entry asks GTK+ to queue a redraw operation for itself.<br>
              <br>
              The windowing system generates events for native windows. The GDK interface to the windowing 
              system translates such native events into <a class="two" href="/content/GDK4/API_Reference/Events.html#GdkEvent"><span class="structname">GdkEvent</span></a> 
              structures and sends them on to the GTK layer. In turn, the GTK layer finds the widget that 
              corresponds to a particular <a class="two" href="/content/GDK3/API_Reference/Windows.html#GdkWindow"><code class="classname">GdkWindow</code></a> 
              and emits the corresponding event signals on that widget.<br>
              <br>
              The following sections describe how GTK+ decides which widgets need to be repainted in 
              response to such events, and how widgets work internally in terms of the resources they use 
              from the windowing system.

              All GTK+ applications are mainloop-driven, which means that most of the time the app is idle 
              inside a loop that just waits for something to happen and then calls out to the right place 
              when it does. On top of this GTK+ has a frame clock that gives a “pulse” to the application. 
              This clock beats at a steady rate, which is tied to the framerate of the output (this is 
              synced to the monitor via the window manager/compositor). The clock has several phases:
          </p>

      <div class="generic-box-main2">
          <p>
              <ul>

                  <li>Update</li>
                  <li>Layout</li>
                  <li>Paint</li>
              </ul>
          </p>
      </div>
      <div class="generic-box-main2">
          <p>
              The phases happens in this order and we will always run each phase through before going back 
              to the start.<br>
              <br>
              The Events phase is a long stretch of time between each redraw where we get input events 
              from the user and other events (like e.g. network I/O). Some events, like mouse motion are 
              compressed so that we only get a single mouse motion event per clock cycle.<br>
              <br>
              Once the Events phase is over we pause all external events and run the redraw loop. First is 
              the Update phase, where all animations are run to calculate the new state based on the 
              estimated time the next frame will be visible (available via the frame clock). This often 
              involves geometry changes which drives the next phase, Layout. If there are any changes in 
              widget size requirements we calculate a new layout for the widget hierarchy (i.e. we assign 
              sizes and positions). Then we go to the Paint phase where we redraw the regions of the window 
              that need redrawing.<br>
              <br>
              If nothing requires the Update/Layout/Paint phases we will stay in the Events phase forever, 
              as we don’t want to redraw if nothing changes. Each phase can request further processing in 
              the following phases (e.g. the Update phase will cause there to be layout work, and layout 
              changes cause repaints).<br>
              <br>
              There are multiple ways to drive the clock, at the lowest level you can request a particular 
              phase with <a class="two" href="/content/GDK3/API_Reference/Frame_clock.html#gdk_frame_clock_request_phase"><code class="function">gdk_frame_clock_request_phase()</code></a> 
              which will schedule a clock beat as needed so that it eventually reaches the requested phase. 
              However, in practice most things happen at higher levels:
          </p>

      <div class="generic-box-main2">
          <p>
              <ul>
                  <li>If you are doing an animation, you can use <a class="two" href="/content/GTK3/Widgets Objects/Abstract_Base/GtkWidget.html#gtk_widget_add_tick_callback"><code class="function">gtk_widget_add_tick_callback()</code></a> 
                      which will cause a regular beating of the clock with a callback in the Update phase 
                      until you stop the tick.</li>
                  <li>If some state changes that causes the size of your widget to change you call 
                      <a class="two" href="/content/GTK3/Widgets Objects/Abstract_Base/GtkWidget.html#gtk_widget_queue_resize"><code class="function">gtk_widget_queue_resize()</code></a> 
                      which will request a Layout phase and mark your widget as needing relayout.</li>
                  <li>If some state changes so you need to redraw some area of your widget you use the 
                      normal <a class="two" href="/content/GTK3/Widgets Objects/Abstract_Base/GtkWidget.html#gtk_widget_queue_draw"><code class="function">gtk_widget_queue_draw()</code></a> 
                      set of functions. These will request a Paint phase and mark the region as needing redraw.</li>

      </div>
      <div class="generic-box-main2">
          <p>
              There are also a lot of implicit triggers of these from the CSS layer (which does animations, 
              resizes and repaints as needed).

              During the Paint phase we will send a single expose event to the toplevel window. The event 
              handler will create a cairo context for the window and emit a GtkWidget::draw() signal on it, 
              which will propagate down the entire widget hierarchy in back-to-front order, using the 
              clipping and transform of the cairo context. This lets each widget draw its content at the 
              right place and time, correctly handling things like partial transparencies and overlapping 
              widgets.<br>
              <br>
              When generating the event, GDK also sets up double buffering to avoid the flickering that 
              would result from each widget drawing itself in turn. The section called <a class="two" href="#Double_buffering">“Double buffering”</a> 
              describes the double buffering mechanism in detail.<br>
              <br>
              Normally, there is only a single cairo context which is used in the entire repaint, rather 
              than one per GdkWindow. This means you have to respect (and not reset) existing clip and 
              transformations set on it.<br>
              <br>
              Most widgets, including those that create their own GdkWindows have a transparent background, 
              so they draw on top of whatever widgets are below them. This was not the case in GTK+ 2 
              where the theme set the background of most widgets to the default background color. (In fact, 
              transparent GdkWindows used to be impossible.)<br>
              <br>
              The whole rendering hierarchy is captured in the call stack, rather than having multiple 
              separate draw emissions, so you can use effects like e.g. cairo_push/pop_group() which will 
              affect all the widgets below you in the hierarchy. This makes it possible to have e.g. 
              partially transparent containers.

              Traditionally, GTK+ has used self-copy operations to implement scrolling with native windows. 
              With transparent backgrounds, this no longer works. Instead, we just mark the entire affected 
              area for repainting when these operations are used. This allows (partially) transparent 
              backgrounds, and it also more closely models modern hardware where self-copy operations are 
              problematic (they break the rendering pipeline).<br>
              <br>
              Since the above causes some overhead, we introduce a caching mechanism. Containers that 
              scroll a lot (<a class="two" href="/content/GTK3/Widgets Objects/Miscellaneous/GtkViewport.html">GtkViewport</a>, 
              <a class="two" href="/content/GTK3/Widgets Objects/Multiline_Text/GtkTextView.html">GtkTextView</a>, 
              <a class="two" href="/content/GTK3/Widgets Objects/TLI_Grid_Widgets/GtkTreeView.html">GtkTreeView</a>, 
              etc) allocate an offscreen image during 
              scrolling and render their children to it (which is possible since drawing is fully hierarchical). 
              The offscreen image is a bit larger than the visible area, so most of the time when scrolling 
              it just needs to draw the offscreen in a different position. This matches contemporary 
              graphics hardware much better, as well as allowing efficient transparent backgrounds. In 
              order for this to work such containers need to detect when child widgets are redrawn so that 
              it can update the offscreen. This can be done with the new <a class="two" href="/content/GDK3/API_Reference/Windows.html#gdk_window_set_invalidate_handler">gdk_window_set_invalidate_handler()</a> 
              function.

              If each of the drawing calls made by each subwidget's <code class="literal">draw</code> 
              handler were sent directly to the windowing system, flicker could result.  This is because 
              areas may get redrawn repeatedly:  the background, then decorative frames, then text labels, 
              etc. To avoid flicker, GTK+ employs a <em class="firstterm">double buffering</em> system at 
              the GDK level. Widgets normally don't know that they are drawing to an off-screen buffer; 
              they just issue their normal drawing commands, and the buffer gets sent to the windowing 
              system when all drawing operations are done.<br>
              <br>
              Two basic functions in GDK form the core of the double-buffering mechanism: 
              <a class="two" href="/content/GDK3/API_Reference/Windows.html#gdk_window_begin_paint_region"><code class="function">gdk_window_begin_paint_region()</code></a> 
              and <a class="two" href="/content/GDK3/API_Reference/Windows.html#gdk_window_end_paint"><code class="function">gdk_window_end_paint()</code></a>. 
              The first function tells a <a class="two" href="/content/GDK3/API_Reference/Windows.html#GdkWindow"><code class="classname">GdkWindow</code></a> 
              to create a temporary off-screen buffer for drawing. All subsequent drawing operations to 
              this window get automatically redirected to that buffer. The second function actually paints 
              the buffer onto the on-screen window, and frees the buffer.
          </p>

      <div class="generic-box-main3">

      </div>
      <div class="generic-box-main2">
          <p>
              It would be inconvenient for all widgets to call <code class="function">gdk_window_begin_paint_region()</code> 
              and <code class="function">gdk_window_end_paint()</code> at the beginning and end of their 
              draw handlers.<br>
              <br>
              To make this easier, GTK+ normally calls <code class="function">gdk_window_begin_paint_region()</code> 
              before emitting the #GtkWidget::draw signal, and then it calls <code class="function">gdk_window_end_paint()</code> 
              after the signal has been emitted. This is convenient for most widgets, as they do not need 
              to worry about creating their own temporary drawing buffers or about calling those functions.<br>
              <br>
              However, some widgets may prefer to disable this kind of automatic double buffering and do 
              things on their own. To do this, call the <a class="two" href="/content/GTK3/Widgets Objects/Abstract_Base/GtkWidget.html#gtk_widget_set_double_buffered"><code class="function">gtk_widget_set_double_buffered()</code></a> 
              function in your widget's constructor. Double buffering can only be turned off for widgets 
              that have a native window.

              When is it convenient to disable double buffering? Generally, this is the case only if your 
              widget gets drawn in such a way that the different drawing operations do not overlap each 
              other. For example, this may be the case for a simple image viewer: it can just draw the 
              image in a single operation. This would <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> be the 
              case with a word processor, since it will need to draw and over-draw the page's background, 
              then the background for highlighted text, and then the text itself.<br>
              <br>
              Even if you turn off double buffering on a widget, you can still call <code class="function">gdk_window_begin_paint_region()</code> 
              and <code class="function">gdk_window_end_paint()</code> by hand to use temporary drawing 
              buffers.

              Generally, applications use the pre-defined widgets in GTK+ and they do not draw extra things 
              on top of them (the exception being <a class="two" href="/content/GTK3/Widgets Objects/Miscellaneous/GtkDrawingArea.html"><code class="classname">GtkDrawingArea</code></a>). 
              However, applications may sometimes find it convenient to draw directly on certain widgets 
              like toplevel windows or event boxes. When this is the case, GTK+ needs to be told not to 
              overwrite your drawing afterwards, when the window gets to drawing its default contents.<br>
              <br>
              <a class="two" href="/content/GTK3/Widgets Objects/Windows/GtkWindow.html"><code class="classname">GtkWindow</code></a> 
              and <a class="two" href="/content/GTK3/Widgets Objects/Miscellaneous/GtkEventBox.html"><code class="classname">GtkEventBox</code></a> 
              are the two widgets that allow turning off drawing of default contents by calling <a class="two" href="/content/GTK3/Widgets Objects/Abstract_Base/GtkWidget.html#gtk_widget_set_app_paintable"><code class="function">gtk_widget_set_app_paintable()</code></a>. 
              If you call this function, they will not draw their contents and let you do it instead.<br>
              <br>
              Since the #GtkWidget::draw signal runs user-connected handlers <span class="emphasis"><em>before</em></span> 
              the widget's default handler, what usually happens is this:
          </p>
      </div>
      <div class="generic-box-main2">
          <p>
              <ol>
                  <li>Your own draw handler gets run. It paints something on the window or the event box.</li>
                  <li>The widget's default draw handler gets run. If <code class="function">gtk_widget_set_app_paintable()</code> 
                  has not been called to turn off widget drawing (this is the default), 
                  <span class="emphasis"><em>your drawing will be overwritten</em></span>. An app paintable 
                  widget will not draw its default contents however and preserve your drawing instead.</li>
                  <li>The draw handler for the parent class gets run. Since both <code class="classname">GtkWindow</code> 
                  and <code class="classname">GtkEventBox</code> are descendants of <a class="two" href="/content/GTK3/Widgets Objects/Abstract_Base/GtkContainer"><code class="classname">GtkContainer</code></a>, 
                  their no-window children will be asked to draw themselves recursively, as described in 
                  the section called <a class="two" href="#Hierarchical_drawing">“Hierarchical drawing”</a>.</li>
              </ol>
          </p>
